/**
 * The gate — whether this tab has been let in, and *as what*.
 *
 * The session carries a **scope**, not a boolean:
 *
 *   'ultra'      signed in at the platform door. Gets the market picker and can
 *                enter any client through it.
 *   '<clientId>' signed in at one client's own door. Is that client. No picker,
 *                and no route to a different tenant.
 *   null         locked.
 *
 * The scope is deliberately authoritative over `selected_client` in
 * localStorage. That key used to be the only record of which tenant you were
 * in, which meant editing it in devtools switched tenant — fine when one
 * credential opened everything, not fine now that a client is handed a link
 * that is supposed to open exactly their own. ClientContext reconciles against
 * this value; see the note there.
 *
 * Scope is per browser TAB (sessionStorage), for both the credential path and
 * the `?access=` bypass. A refresh keeps you in — which matters mid-demo — but
 * closing the tab does not leave the machine unlocked.
 *
 * ⚠️  Not a security boundary. See config/access.ts.
