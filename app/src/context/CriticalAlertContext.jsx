/**
 * CriticalAlertContext — the Unit 3 man-down alert, held above the routes.
 *
 * The alert has to outlive navigation. Every one of its actions sends Gina
 * somewhere else in the app — the camera wall, the muster page — and an alert
 * that reset when she followed its own link would be worse than useless. So the
 * lifecycle lives in a provider mounted in the shell, and the band and panel
 * are just views onto it.
 *
 * **Who gets this:** the HSE GM alone. The provider returns an inert value for
 * every other persona, so the other three Aramco personas and every other
 * tenant mount a context that never arms and renders nothing.
 *
 * **When it arrives.** Not on load, and not on a clock from mount. The alert is
 * cued off the conversation: it arms when Gina reaches "What should I act on
 * before the night shift?" and lands a few seconds later, while she is reading
 * the answer. That is the whole point of the beat — she asks what to deal with
 * before handing over, and the site answers with something that will not wait.
 * Landing it a little after the turn rather than on it keeps it from reading as
 * a scripted response to the question.
 *
 * **Where it lives.** A one-line strip under the header, plus a right-hand
 * incident drawer. The drawer is a *column*, not a band that grows downward:
 * the page reserves margin for it rather than being pushed down by it, so the
 * conversation keeps its full height and its scroll position while the incident
 * is open beside it. That is why the drawer can arrive already open — it covers
 * nothing.
 *
 * **What else moves on its own:** only the rescue team acknowledging a callout
 * she has already made. Every status transition is something Gina did. A demo
 * that advances itself is a demo that gets away from whoever is presenting it.
