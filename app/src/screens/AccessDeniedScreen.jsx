/**
 * Refusal at the platform door.
 *
 * Shown when a session that belongs to one client tries to reach
 * `/login/ultra` — the market and client picker. Those users hold neither the
 * access link nor the platform credential, so the picker is not theirs, and the
 * honest answer is to say so rather than to bounce them somewhere quietly.
 *
 * Two things this screen deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *  • It does not show the sign-in form. Somebody who arrives here has already
 *    been identified as a client user; offering them a platform login box
 *    invites them to try passwords.
 *  • It does not mention the `?access=` link or name the credential. "You need
 *    a token" is a hint; "this is not your door" is an answer.
 *
 * It is styled as Ultra rather than as the client, because the thing refusing
 * is the platform, and dressing the refusal in the client's own brand would
 * imply their tenant is what stopped them.
 *
 * ⚠️  Not a security boundary. See config/access.ts — everything this screen
 * withholds is still in the bundle it was served from.
