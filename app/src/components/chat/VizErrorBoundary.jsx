/**
 * Keeps one broken visualization from taking down the whole conversation.
 *
 * Every persona hand-binds its JSON metrics to a React component in the
 * manifest's `inlineComponents` factory, so a renamed or re-nested field is a
 * render-time TypeError rather than anything the type system catches. Without a
 * boundary that error reaches the root and React unmounts the entire tree — the
 * page goes white, nav and all. (That is exactly how Newfold's save-desk panel
 * failed: it read `saveRateProjection` off `metrics.saveDesk` instead of the
 * root of the file.)
 *
 * The fallback is deliberately small and quiet. These are live client demos, so
 * a missing chart should read as one card that didn't load, not as a stack trace
 * on screen. The real error still goes to the console for whoever is debugging.
