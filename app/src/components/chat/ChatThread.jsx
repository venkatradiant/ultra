/**
 * Every ancestor that *could* scroll vertically.
 *
 * All of them, not the first one that currently overflows: this runs on the
 * first paint of a restored thread, when the messages have not been laid out
 * and so nothing overflows yet. Picking by `scrollHeight > clientHeight` there
 * selects nothing and the restore quietly does nothing at all.
 *
 * Which one really scrolls also varies by persona — the thread's own container
 * in most layouts, the page column in the ones where the whole `/ask` view
 * scrolls as a unit. Pinning a container that is not scrolling is a no-op, so
 * pinning all of them is both simpler and correct in either case.

  //
  // The effect below could not do this, and the reason is worth stating. It
  // scrolls *smoothly*, which takes time, and a restored thread's inline
  // components — the prioritised actions, the muster board, the maps — resolve
  // their fixtures asynchronously and grow the column after the scroll has
  // already committed to a target. The animation finishes against a position
  // that has since moved, and she lands back near the greeting instead of on
  // the turn she left: exactly the bug the restore exists to prevent.
  //
  // Nor is `scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })` enough on its own. `nearest`
  // scrolls the *minimum* to bring the sentinel into view, so when the last
  // turn is taller than the viewport — which the HSE GM's prioritised-actions
  // turn is — it aligns that turn's top and stops. Measured on that turn it
  // recovered 374px of a 706px gap.
  //
  // So the scroller is pinned outright, and re-pinned on a short interval while
  // the column is still growing. A `ResizeObserver` would be the tidier trigger
  // and was tried first, but its callbacks are delivered with the rendering
  // steps, which a backgrounded tab does not run — so a thread restored in a
  // tab that was not frontmost never got its second pin. Timers fire either
  // way.
  //
  // It yields to her immediately: one deliberate scroll and the pinning stops,
  // so this can never fight someone reading back through the thread.
