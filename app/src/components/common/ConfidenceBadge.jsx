/**
 * "AI Confidence: 94%" — the pill that sits on every consequential card.
 *
 * Generic across tenants: the colours come from Ultra's confidence helpers, so
 * it follows whichever brand's confHigh/confMed/confLow tokens are active
 * rather than hardcoding a green. Lived in `components/doit/shared/TrustBits`
 * until AMISA needed it too; that module re-exports it, so the DoIT cards that
 * import it from there did not have to change.
 *
 * These are authored scores, not model output. The point they make is that a
 * consequential number arrives with a number attached to how much to trust it.
